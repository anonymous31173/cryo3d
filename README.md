### Short description  
*cryo3d* is a matlab-based software that allows for fast 3D protein reconstruction based on cryogenic particle images. The software was developped at [Image Processing and Analysis Group](http://medicine.yale.edu/bioimaging/ipa/), Yale School of Medicine, Dept. of Diagnostic Radiology under supervision and with participation of Prof. Hemant Tagare. 

### The project structure  
`/doc` : contains project description-related documents    
`/script` : main `*.m` scripts of the pipeline and main workspace (the Matlab should be run from that folder)  
`/src` : `*.m` functions, arranged by the different pipeline step, e.g., preprocessing, best_match, etc; `mrc` folder contains function to read-write `*.mrc` files  
`/test` : temporal functions that are under development, subject to delete for the final release version   

### Source code  

To download the source code of the pipeline, run the following commands:  
```
git clone https://github.com/vicrucann/cryo3d
``` 
To get the submodules (cacharr and rshell-mat):  
```
cd cryo3d
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Running the whole pipeline

**User must provide configuration file as an input for the `\script\cryo3d.m` function (you can find an example of such file for both Windows and Linux in `script` folder.**    

### Main preprocessing components and their outputs
	1. (...)	    	->	fit_ctfs.m 	            -> fit-ctfs.mat
	2. fit-ctfs.mat 	-> 	proprocess_images.m 	-> pre-imgs.mrcs
	3. (...)	    	->	init_volume.m   		-> ini-vol.mrc
	4. (...)    		->	coordinate_axes.m       -> coord-ax.mat

### Author information
All of function for fast best match method were written by Nicha Dvornek. The improvements like main framework, distributor package, caching class and few others were written by Victoria Rudakova. For inquires on additional packages: vicrucann(at)gmail(dot)com.
